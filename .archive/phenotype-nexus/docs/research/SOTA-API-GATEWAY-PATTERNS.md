## State of the Art: API Gateway Patterns and Architectures

### Executive Summary

API gateways have evolved from simple reverse proxies into sophisticated platforms handling cross-cutting concerns for distributed systems. Modern API gateway architecture must address traffic management, security enforcement, protocol translation, and developer experience across diverse deployment environments from cloud to edge.

The architectural patterns for API gateways have diversified to meet different scale and organizational requirements. From centralized enterprise gateways to decentralized microgateways and service mesh integration, each pattern presents distinct trade-offs between consistency, autonomy, and operational complexity.

This research examines proven API gateway patterns, comparing their applicability across different organizational scales and technical constraints. The analysis synthesizes patterns from industry implementations, microservices literature, and cloud-native best practices.

Key findings suggest that most organizations benefit from a tiered gateway approach combining edge gateways for external traffic with service mesh or microgateways for internal service-to-service communication. Pure centralized or fully decentralized approaches each introduce significant limitations at scale.

### Deployment Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Blue-Green Deployment

```
Production Traffic
    |
    v
[Blue Environment] (Current)
    
[Green Environment] (New - tested)
    |
    v
Switch traffic instantly
```

**Benefits**:
- Zero downtime
- Instant rollback
- Full environment validation

**Requirements**:
- Double infrastructure
- Database compatibility
- Session handling

#### Strategy 2: Rolling Deployment

```
Pool of instances
    |
    v
One by one:
- Remove from LB
- Update
- Health check
- Add to LB
```

**Benefits**:
- Resource efficient
- Gradual risk
- No extra capacity

**Challenges**:
- Version compatibility
- Rollback complexity
- Longer deployment

#### Strategy 3: Canary Deployment

```
100% traffic
    |
    +--> 95% Old version
    |
    +--> 5% New version (monitored)
         |
         v
    Gradual increase if healthy
```

**Metrics to Monitor**:
- Error rate
- Latency
- Business metrics
- Resource usage
- Custom KPIs

### Monitoring and Observability

#### The Three Pillars

1. **Metrics** (Numeric data over time)
   - System metrics: CPU, memory, disk
   - Application metrics: Requests, latency
   - Business metrics: Transactions, revenue

2. **Logs** (Discrete events)
   - Application logs
   - Access logs
   - Audit logs
   - Error logs

3. **Traces** (Request flow)
   - Distributed tracing
   - Service dependencies
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Critical path analysis

#### Alerting Strategy

| Severity | Response Time | Examples | Notification |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| P1 (Critical) | Immediate | Service down, Data loss | Page/Call |
| P2 (High) | 15 minutes | Degraded performance | Page |
| P3 (Medium) | 1 hour | Warnings, capacity | Slack |
| P4 (Low) | Next day | Cleanup, optimization | Email |

### Cost Optimization

#### Cloud Cost Management

| Strategy | Implementation | Savings |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Reserved capacity | 1-3 year commits | 30-60% |
| Spot instances | Interruptible workloads | 70-90% |
| Auto-scaling | Right-sizing | 20-40% |
| Storage tiers | Lifecycle policies | 50-80% |
| Multi-cloud | Negotiation leverage | 10-20% |

#### FinOps Practices

1. **Visibility**: Tagging and attribution
2. **Optimization**: Right-sizing and efficiency
3. **Governance**: Budgets and policies
4. **Culture**: Shared responsibility

### Disaster Recovery

#### RTO and RPO Definitions

| Tier | RTO (Recovery Time) | RPO (Data Loss) | Implementation |

| Tier 2 | < 4 hours | < 1 hour | Hot Standby |
| Tier 3 | < 24 hours | < 24 hours | Warm Standby |
| Tier 4 | < 72 hours | < 1 week | Cold Backup |

#### DR Strategies

- **Backup and Restore**: Simple, slow recovery
- **Pilot Light**: Minimal standby, scale up
- **Warm Standby**: Ready capacity, quick switch
- **Active-Active**: Dual operation, instant
- **Multi-Region**: Geographic distribution
